I am a graduate student in the [Department of Geography](https://geography.ua.edu/) at the [The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa](https://www.ua.edu/). My research interests include geographic information science (GIS), remote sensing, and deep learning specifically applying computer vision to geospatial data. I am always looking for collaboration opportunities for work or research in these field.
